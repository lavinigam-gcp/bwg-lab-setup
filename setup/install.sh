  --track {2,3}      which track to set up. Without it the script asks, and falls
                     back to Track 2 when there is no terminal to ask on
  --dry-run          print every command, change nothing (never asks for a track)
  --only STEP        run one step: ${ALL_STEPS[*]}
                     --only starterkit implies --track 3 when no track is given
  --with-extras      also install ffmpeg, VS Code, Playwright's browser
  --force            rebuild an existing venv, or overwrite existing session folders.
                     On Track 3 it also moves an existing starter-kit folder aside,
                     with any work you have done in it, and fetches the kit again
  --yes              do not prompt (does NOT override a preflight NO-GO)
  --skip-preflight   do not run preflight first
  --root DIR         parent of Desktop/SessionN (default: \$HOME)
  --skills-src DIR   directory holding the lab skills (not shipped in this repo)
  --kit-dir DIR      Track 3 only: where to clone the starter kit
                     (default: \$LAB_ROOT/Desktop/build-with-gemini)
  --kit-url URL      Track 3 only: the starter kit repository, a community repo
                     (default: $KIT_URL)
  --kit-ref REF      Track 3 only: the commit, tag or branch of the starter kit to
